### More about Firestore

Cloud Firestore is flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud.

Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL, document-oriented database.

Data is stored in documents, which are organized into collections.

Each document contains a set of key-value pairs.

All documents must be stored in collections. Documents can contain subcollections and nested objects, both of which can include primitive fields like strings or complex objects like lists.

In Cloud Firestore, the unit of storage is the document. A document is a lightweight record that contains fields, which map to values. Each document is identified by a name.
